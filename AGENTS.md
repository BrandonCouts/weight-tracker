# AGENTS

## Repository Overview
This project provides a simple weight tracking application with a Node.js/Express backend, a Vue 3 frontend, and a MySQL database.

## Code Guidelines
- Use two spaces for indentation.
- Use single quotes in JavaScript and end statements with semicolons.
- Keep SQL keywords uppercase.
- Place new database scripts inside `database/scripts`.

## Testing
Run `npm test` within any package that provides tests. For now the `backend` and `frontend` packages do not define tests, so the command will exit with a message if no tests are present.
